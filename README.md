# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who are working on the Prework modules. It contains a few notes on each of the four languages covered in the Prework. Those are: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. They contain useful vocabulary for each launguage. I used JavaScript to create a suggestion for what to study first. To access this open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
